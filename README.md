Breast Cancer Diagnostic Models
This repository contains machine learning model built for predicting breast cancer diagnosis using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.
Random Forest Classifier Model
The random forest classifier model is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and robustness of predictions. It works by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. This model was trained using the scikit-learn library with 100 decision trees and achieved a certain level of accuracy in predicting breast cancer diagnoses.
